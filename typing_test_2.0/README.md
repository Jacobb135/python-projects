Typing Speed App
This is a simple Python GUI application that tests the user's typing speed. It displays a random sentence that the user must type as quickly and accurately as possible, and displays their typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

Usage
To use this program, simply run the TypingTest() function in your Python environment. This will launch the GUI window and display a random sentence for the user to type.

Once the user starts typing, the program will start a timer and calculate their typing speed in WPM. If the user makes a mistake, the input field will turn red to indicate an error. If the user types the entire sentence correctly, the input field will turn green to indicate success.

The user can reset the test at any time by clicking the "Reset" button. This will clear the input field, reset the timer and WPM counter, and display a new random sentence for the user to type.

Dependencies
This program requires the tkinter and random_words packages to be installed. You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install tkinter
pip install random_words
