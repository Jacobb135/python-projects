This is a simple typing speed app built using Python's tkinter module. The app generates a random string of words and times the user as they type it. The app also displays the user's typing speed and highest score.

Getting Started
To run the app, you need to have Python 3 and the following modules installed:

tkinter
threading
time
random_words
Once the modules are installed, you can run the app by running the typing_speed.py file.

How to Use
When you run the app, a window will appear with the random string of words generated for you to type. Start typing in the input field and the timer will start automatically. If you make a mistake, the input field will turn red. Once you complete typing the string, the timer will stop and your typing speed will be displayed. You can reset the app by clicking the "Reset" button.

The app also displays your highest score in WPM (Words Per Minute). Your highest score is saved in a file called "high_score.txt" in the same directory as the app.
